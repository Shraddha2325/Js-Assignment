<h2>Brief intro on Datatypes in JS</h2>
<p>A value in JavaScript is always of a certain type. For example, a string or a number.

There are eight basic data types in JavaScript. Here, we’ll cover them in general and in the next chapters we’ll talk about each of them in detail.<br>
1 Number: The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type: Infinity, -Infinity, etc.<br>
2 String: A string in JavaScript must be surrounded by quotes.<br>
3 Boolean: The boolean type has only two values: true and false.This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no, incorrect”.<br>
4 Null: The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above.It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value.<br>
5 Undefined: The special value undefined also stands apart. It makes a type of its own, just like null.The meaning of undefined is “value is not assigned”.
